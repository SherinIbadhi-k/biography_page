# Bio Page – CSS Challenge

This is a simple bio page I styled using basic CSS. The goal was to practice selectors, fonts, colors, borders, and hover effects. It includes a short intro, job title, and contact info – all styled with custom CSS.

Built as part of a learning challenge to get better at writing clean, simple styles.
